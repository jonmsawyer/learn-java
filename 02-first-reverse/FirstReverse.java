/**************************************************************************************************
 * File: FirstReverse.java
 *
 * Return the reversal of an input string
 *
 * For this exercise, we have a class called FirstReverse with a main() function and a public
 * String firstReverse() function. Fill out the code in the firstReverse() function to return a
 * String whos contents are reversed. For example, "Hello world!" should return "!dlrow olleH".
 *
 * Sample test cases
 * -----------------
 *
 * Input: Hello world!
 * Output: !dlrow olleH
 *
 * Input: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
 * Output: tema tis rolod muspi meroL
 *
 * How I will be "grading" your work
 * ---------------------------------
 *
 * 1. (1 pt) Unglob all imports. Always unglob. Always use specific imports so the population
 *    of the namespace is explicit, rather than ambiguous.
 * 2. (18 pts) In every excercise, I am going to make code cleanliness, indentation, variable
 *    readability, comments, etc. to be worth 50% of the points. This is because people must read
 *    and write your code and seasoned programmers (yourself included after a while) will abhor
 *    unclean code. You will come to appreciate thoughtful, expressive, organized, and documented
 *    code throughout your programming journey and it's best to gain the discipline now, rather
 *    than later. Things to correct and watch out for:
 *    a) All indents must be 4 spaces. Do not use tabs. (Hint: in this exercise I am giving you
 *       code that is formatted to 2 spaces for indents...)
 *    b) Remove all extra whitespace at the end of every line. Whitespace usage on blank lines to
 *       keep indentation from prior lines is OK.
 *    c) Provide empty line spacing around groups of related code. Put spacing around classes,
 *       method and function definitions, etc.
 *    d) Refactor ("refactor" in programming parlance is to rename, reclassify, or recode some
 *       piece of your code *without* changing the way that object interacts with your code) any
 *       odd variable names. All variable names should self document and provide some form of
 *       clarity as to what its function is. This part is really an art form so don't stress too
 *       much about it. (Hint: in this exercise there's an integer variable called "num". Wut?)
 *    e) !!Documentation, documentation, documenation!! Even though these exercises are relatively
 *       small in scope, from now on, let's assume that you're programming a small, reusable,
 *       code library that others will look at and use. Other programmers must be able to grok your
 *       code effectively (it's not an easy task to just read a piece of code and inherently know
 *       what it does -- that comes with experience). Assume that, for the most part, your audience
 *       are fellow programmers in your shop. Your goal is to provide enough documentation in your
 *       code such that no one needs to come to you for an explaination on what your code is doing.
 *       Furthermore, when you come back to this library months or years later, you won't remember
 *       much about your code so you'll end up trying to grok your own code (and then wonder what
 *       noobie wrote this monstrosity all to realize it was you, hehe [true story, many times]).
 *       Also, begin reading up on and learning "javadoc" style of documentation. A simple
 *       "javadoc" comment block is included for you.
 * 3. (6 pts) Efficiency of code. Is your code expressive? Does it really take 200 lines of code
 *    to do this one search algorithm or is there a more efficient way of performing the task? Does
 *    your code enslave the processor unnecessarily? Always think of ways to do the most amount of
 *    work with the least amount of code and processor time. (This will be a skill I'll help you
 *    out with over the course of doing these exercises. The science of mathematical, programmatic,
 *    and physical efficiency of algorithms is the heart of "Computer Science". There is useful
 *    information to be learned in this field.)
 *    a) 3 points will go toward efficiency regarding how your code is written. (Less is more.)
 *    b) 3 points will go toward efficiency regarding how un-busy your processor is throughout the
 *       runtime of your program. (Less is more.)
 * 4. (10 pts) Correct solution. Your solution must correctly parse and compute the reversal of an
 *    arbitrary input string, including but not limited to the test cases above. Pay attention to
 *    any assumptions outlined in the exercise and/or in the code itself. If you assume something
 *    not listed, document it. Be prepared to injest this entire exercise as well :)
 * 5. (1 pt) Have fun! Please let me know if you have any questions.
 * 6. (5 pts extra credit) Provide another (correct) method within the FirstFactorial class,
 *    reverseAlternate, which computes the reverse of an input string, but make the solution
 *    fundamentally different in approach. So let's see another "way" of solving this problem!
 *
 * Total number of possible points: 36 + 5

/**
 * Discussion for after a correct solution has been found:
 *   1. Now that you know how to reverse a string, can you think of ways to optimize your
 *      algorithm? Do you know of any ways to reduce the amount of code you've written? How many
 *      lines did you use and how many do you think could be minimally used? Hint: I used 5 lines
 *      (without comments) of readable, clean, code.
 *   2. Which control structures, if any, did you use in your algorithm? Why did you choose that
 *      structure? Is there a better, more elegant, structure?
 *   3. Using glob based imports (java.util.*) as opposed to explicit imports (java.util.Scanner)
 *      can be problematic. Why? Let's discuss this point in philosophy.
 *   4. What advantages are there for having clean, consistent, readable code? What are some
 *      disadvantages?
 *      a) Question: Who interacts with your code more: you (the writer) or everyone
 *                   else (the reader)? Knowing this, what can we do help the widest audience
 *                   do cool stuff with your code?
